# Steam-Game-Recommendation-System-Projec
Steam is an online store that sells PC games to its users. Games can be viewed as items, and the players can be viewed as users. To stimulate its users to purchase more games, Steam offers a type of selling method called game-bundle. A game-bundle ties several games together, yet the price of a game-bundle is always less than the net price of these games. Our task is to decide what bundle will interest the target user the most and generate a personalized bundle for each user. Data is from https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#steam_data
